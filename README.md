# 6174_trick
Hello There!!
Here I will show a math trick! That is 6174 TRICK!!!
So , you have to choose a 4 digit number in which at least 2 number should be different.
And I will perform simple Subtraction by rearranging the number in ascending or descending order!!
In the last the answer would be always 6174!!!!!
I will not change any digits !! rather i rearrange them in an order.
3218
Entered number is 3218
Here it goes!!!!!
Subtraction 1  : 8321 - 1238 = 7083
Subtraction 2 : 8730 - 378 = 8352
Subtraction 3 : 8532 - 2358 = 6174
Thus at last we got 6174 !!!
